# Hammerspoon starter plan (non-window features)

## Goal
Set up a beginner-friendly Hammerspoon config that showcases useful automation without overlapping with Aerospace window management.

## User constraints
- User is new to Hammerspoon.
- Do **not** add window tiling/sizing/movement bindings.
- Keep the setup easy to understand and iterate on.

## Critical file to modify
- `config/hammerspoon/init.lua`

## Recommended implementation approach
1. **Bootstrap + feedback**
   - Add a small `notify()` helper for clear success/error alerts.
   - Add config autoreload watcher for `~/.hammerspoon/*.lua` (or local config path) so edits reload automatically.
   - Add startup alert/log line confirming config loaded.

2. **Shared keybinding foundation**
   - Define one low-conflict modifier set (e.g. `ctrl + alt + cmd`).
   - Create a tiny binding wrapper that stores each shortcut + description for a generated cheat sheet.

3. **App launcher (high value for new users)**
   - Implement `hs.chooser`-based launcher for a short list of user apps.
   - Bind launcher hotkey (e.g. `Hyper + A`) to focus/launch selected app.

4. **Clipboard history**
   - Track clipboard changes in a bounded in-memory ring (e.g. 30 entries).
   - Provide chooser UI to select a previous item and copy/paste it back.
   - Bind hotkey (e.g. `Hyper + V`).

5. **System toggles (non-window)**
   - Caffeine toggle (`hs.caffeinate`) with visible ON/OFF alerts.
   - Microphone mute toggle (`hs.audiodevice.defaultInputDevice()`), with feedback.
   - Dark mode toggle (`hs.osascript`/appearance API), with feedback.

6. **Utility shortcuts + help**
   - Add hotkeys for reload, Hammerspoon console, and opening dotfiles.
   - Add `Hyper + /` cheatsheet showing all registered shortcuts and descriptions.

## Verification checklist
1. Reload config from menu and via hotkey; confirm no console errors.
2. Edit/save `config/hammerspoon/init.lua`; verify autoreload alert appears.
3. Trigger app launcher; select app; verify app launches/focuses.
4. Copy several text snippets; open clipboard chooser; restore one; verify paste output.
5. Toggle caffeine/mic/dark mode; verify state changes and alerts.
6. Open cheatsheet; verify listed shortcuts match implemented bindings.

## Caveats to account for
- Ensure Accessibility/Input Monitoring permissions are granted for global hotkeys and automation APIs.
- Keep clipboard feature lightweight to avoid conflicts with existing clipboard managers.
- Keep all window-management APIs out of scope to avoid overlap with Aerospace.
