#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0

; Flow Launcher on Win+Space
; - Pressing the Windows key alone still opens the Start Menu
; - Win+Space will launch (if not running) or toggle Flow Launcher (by sending its default Alt+Space hotkey)
; - If you changed Flow Launcher's own hotkey, modify the Send() line accordingly
;
; Note: Win+Space is normally used by Windows for input language switching. This script overrides that combo.
